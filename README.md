# AmazingMaze
2D Game made on SDL, involving kills, maze, puzle, and quick actions at the same time.
This game is made under SDL 2.0 working with C/C++
the ide that was used on this project is Clion but i think you can use whatever IDE you want to edit this. 

The idea of this game is just to get some fun and to project my way of how a game should be, this project is being built using CMAKE so you can import it into almost every IDE out there.

Was built under linux and the versions im currently using are 

-CMAKE 3.13.4
-GCC 8.3.0.3.3
-G++ 8.3.0.3.3
-VIM
-CLION 2019.3
-SDL libsdl2-2.0.0

 And all you need to do to run it its to execute the make and then just run the program
